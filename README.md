# US2StarTool (About)

In agile methods, the requirements are represented by user stories. However, this model does not allow a good visualization of context in which a story is inserted, reducing the understanding of the system as a whole. On the other hand, the i* model presents dependencies among organizational actors, and the understanding of the context in which a requirement is inserted. The US2StarTool is an implementation of an automated solution as a tool to mapping user stories into i* models, adding a support for agile development environment. US2StarTool can help engineering requirements in agile development environments contextualizing the environment in which user stories are inserted and showing relationships between the actors and the system.
